1. What is the runtime of the Dynamic subsequence algorithm?
Answer:

According to my code the runtime of dynamic subsequence algorithm O(n^2)
But since it have binary search the algorithm will have time complexity O(n log n).


2. What are the possible four maximum subsequences to the sequence above?

It have 4 maximum subsequences

4. What is the runtime of the matching DP algorithm?

Ans:

The runtime for the matching DP is O(M * N) 

5. What is the space required to implement the algorithm?

Ans:

then it needs O(n) space to store 

6. Analyze the runtime and space usage of your Move to front algorithm

Ans:

Since I have used 256 character the run time and front usage of move-to-front is 
O(N+M) because it checks the input from the string. let N be  Character and M is my char size array

And space complicity will be O(n)
